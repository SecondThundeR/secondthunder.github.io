This repository is used to store and host the landing page *(Nothing more, for now)*

This page is fully optimized for computers. Mobile devices have been superficially tested and there may be inconsistencies on different devices *(Perhaps someday I will rewrite this on some framework to work correctly on mobile devices)*

## About previous repo

This is recreated repository for landing page, due to bloated `.git/objects` folder, because of older assets from previous versions, like large videos, photos, files and etc.

In order to see older changes, go to [old repository](https://github.com/SecondThundeR/archived-landing-page)
