This repository is used to store and host the landing page *(Nothing more, for now)*

This page is fully optimized for computers. Mobile devices have been superficially tested and there may be inconsistencies on different devices *(Perhaps someday I will rewrite this on some framework to work correctly on mobile devices)*
