This repository is used to store and host the landing page _(Nothing more, for now)_

This landing page is built using Astro for best performance. The styling uses Tailwind CSS with custom settings. The page also supports redirects to some links, just write `/r/{service-name}` after the main link

> Note: In the future this page will be completely redesigned and switching the current version to Astro is necessary for comfortable development over time
